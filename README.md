##Territory

**What is a territory?**

Territories define specific geographic regions that your company uses to organize and assign leads. 
For example, create a territory called “New England” that includes Massachusetts and Vermont, 
or “New York Metro” that includes everything within 25 miles of New York City.


**What can I do with territories? **

After you create one or more territories, you can use the Lead Distribution 
page to assign new leads in a territory to a specific user or team. You can also filter by territories from the leads, companies, or people tabs.


**Territory order **
Territories processes this list from the top down. Place your most precise territories at the top (e.g. cities and postal codes), 
and wider ranging territories at the bottom.


**Recalculating territories**
When you modify and save your territories, Cheetah will ask if you want to recalculate all territories using the new rules. 
Note that you can also manually change a person or company’s territory.
