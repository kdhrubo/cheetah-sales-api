## How Sales Process Work in Cheetah Sales?


### Lead Generation 

Generating leads is the first step in a sales process. There are various methods for sales prospecting. 
Everyday you send out a dozen or more sales prospecting emails and make a ton of cold calls in search of leads who might be interested in your solution. 
You receive queries from potential customers through emails and web form submissions. 
You find prospects seeking suggestions and advices on social channels before making a purchase. 

### Lead Qualification

Lead qualification is the process of evaluating prospect’s willingness to buy from you. 
Lead qualification helps you save time spent on prospects who never buy from you.
CRM’s profile scoring and engagement scoring features enable you to identify and focus on your most valuable prospects.


## Territory

**What is a territory?**

Territories define specific geographic regions that your company uses to organize and assign leads. 
For example, create a territory called “New England” that includes Massachusetts and Vermont, 
or “New York Metro” that includes everything within 25 miles of New York City.


**What can I do with territories?**

After you create one or more territories, you can use the Lead Distribution 
page to assign new leads in a territory to a specific user or team. You can also filter by territories from the leads, companies, or people tabs.


**Territory order**

Territories processes this list from the top down. Place your most precise territories at the top (e.g. cities and postal codes), 
and wider ranging territories at the bottom.


**Recalculating territories**

When you modify and save your territories, Cheetah will ask if you want to recalculate all territories using the new rules. 
Note that you can also manually change a person or company’s territory.
